# Purpose
We aim at integrating patient’s data with synthetic data of other patients in the city Rome and medicinal data from drug databases. We aim that such data and knowledge should help the physician obtain a second opinion about the drugs for prescription and decide its dosage to administer in case a patient has comorbidities along with given main disease. And also make the physician aware of drugs which are reassessed, or in process of disap- proval in Italy or Europe. This data integration could also help patients fetch their medical reports from the given hospital or let the hospital management handle their patient’s data for increasing the personalised care of the patients based on their disease’s gravity.
