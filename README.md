# KDE-2022-Project_RomeCNR
This repository is for KGE-Project developed during the KGE2022-23 course.

This project deals with patients data from Rome CNR and sythetic data from Synthea to integrate to help make a Knowledge Graph (KG).

- Such KGE might help how several entities involved in healthcare sector and service such as patients, physicians, pharmacies access necessary information such as past disease history of patient, retrieve reports of patients, major diagnostics conducted, medications administered to patients, and allow hospital management manage patients based on severity of the their disease condition.
- Such KG could even help a given hospital share patient's information to other hospital in case the patient transfers to a new address or location into a new city/same city and needs urgent treatment for his disease condition (only after patient's consent to transfer his medical data). It can also help patient to get treated in another  superspeciality hospital (on a priority basis) far from his current address if his current hospital lacks services/equipments or medical professionals to deal with his urgent medical condition.
- Such KG could help the new hospital take necessary steps towards patient's fast treament without losing time.
